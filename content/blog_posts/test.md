### First Blog Post 
Hi! I’m **Marina Casado**, and this is my little corner of the internet.  

I’ve just finished my **BSc in Science: Double Major in Theoretical and Experimental Physics at Maynooth University**, and now I’m starting a new chapter at the **University of Edinburgh**, where I’m studying an **MSc in Theoretical Physics**.  

During my undergraduate degree, I took several modules in astrophysics and cosmology, which is where my passion for these subjects really grew. At Edinburgh, I’m hoping to explore them even further, and I’m both excited (and a little nervous!) about what’s ahead. 

I want this blog to be a place where I share bits of my journey: what I’m learning, the challenges, the discoveries, and maybe even the occasional tangent about physics and  life.  

So, here goes. Thanks for reading, and welcome along!
